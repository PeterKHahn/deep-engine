POMCoP
  POMCoP talks a lot about belief space. Should our AI take into account what
  our opponent is doing? If it is solving puzzles, then no. If it is playing
  against a player, then this may be much more important.

  Monte-Carlo planning: Good for domains with large state spaces. Continuous
  space? This could be good for this. Keep in note, this is a 2012 paper,
  so it could be very well outdated. But something to keep in mind.


Dimensions of a Fighting Game
  Position:
    - x (float)
    - y (float)
    - z (float)
    - facing direction (boolean)
    - grounded (boolean)
  State:
    - Hitstun (int) (number of frames left)
    - Movestun (int) (number of frames left of attack)
    - Move number (the move that we are within. Perhaps this should be one feature per attack)
      - Keep this as a one-hot vector
  Existence:
    - What character you are
      - Do we need a separate training for each character? It is possible
