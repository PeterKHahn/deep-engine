All objects in the game world are entity. If they do not have an effect on the
world, then they do not serve a purpose.
- Game Entity
  - Dynamic Entity: Entities that update on a tick, which means that their
    effect on the world changes at each time step.
      - Movement: Entities can be Dynamic and not move, or they can move. 
  - Static Entity: Entities that have effects on the world, but are static
